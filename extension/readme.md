# Fralsec

This is a (currently only) Chrome extension designed for work within Truesec SOC. This tool is to be used with outmost understanding that it's still in early days. If there was a name for pre'pre MVP this would be the pre version of that.

BUT.... IF IT WORKS, DONT BREAK IT!!

## Description

This extension is intended for dual purpose at this stage:

Part 1:

Upon highlighting text you can right click the selected and send to some sweet security sites. These will open in a new tab and set as focused.

Part 2:

As we have a massive amount of customers in our resources I've come up with this temporary solution to combat the issue where you have to swap pages every other second...
So... If you press the icon  you're supposed to get up some kind off dashboard where you can see who of our customers have alarms popping at this current time. And if found, you can press it to be sent to that CB instance.  

## Bug report and suggestions

There's a directory called "Trash" within this repo; in there there's a .md file. Fill this up with your "important" suggestions etc...

Wanna help/want to know how i made this? Ask the master Fredrik Norling for a quick walkthrough!


## How to acquire this sweet piece as Chrome Extension?

As of know in early stages it is not deployed to chrome store. So you have to add it in developer mode.
Clone the repo into somewhere useful
Go to: "chrome://extensions/"
Engage developer mode
Press "load unpacked"
Select the dir named "Extension" (the one containing the manifest)
Pray to the good lord it works
